        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a multi-media specialist who is based in the Central Florida area. I'm born and raised in FL, coming from Temple Terrace to Polk County! I specialize in videography, photography, and graphic design. While I'm still new to the game, I love to create and bring people joy through my works. I lean more towards the fantasy or mystical side rather than the professional side of the job.</p> 
            <p>Usually when I'm not busy working on stuff you can catch me either reading some fantasy book, playing video games, or trying to catch up on sleep.</p>

        <h2>What Inspires Me</h2>
            <p>What inspired me to start designing is just the love of creative freedom, and I know that usually when you get with a business it is hard to get the creative freedom back. That is why my tagline is <em>Stay Creative to Keep Creative</em> in order for me to keep doing what I love, I need to stay creative.</p>
            <p>What continues to inspire me is my friends and clients who help push me out of my comfort zone. They help me come up with ideas for photoshoots, video ideas, and just overall design ideas. Without them, I would not be where I am currently.</p>
